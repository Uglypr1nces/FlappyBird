# Flappy Bird

Welcome to my Flappy Bird project created using Unity!

## Description

This project is a clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, where the player controls a bird by pressing a key to make it fly and avoid obstacles. The goal is to navigate the bird through gaps between pipes for as long as possible without crashing into them. With simple controls and addictive gameplay, Flappy Bird is a timeless classic that has captivated players for years.
